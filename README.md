  TODO: For this logo to display correctly on GitHub/web, you should:
  1. Place your actual app logo (e.g., a PNG or SVG file, not an XML drawable) 
     in a suitable directory, for example, create an 'assets' folder in your project root 
     and put the logo there (e.g., 'assets/app_logo.png').
  2. Update the src path below to be relative to the README.md file (e.g., "assets/app_logo.png").
  The current path points to an XML drawable which won't render as an image on most Markdown viewers.

An intuitive Smart Home application built with modern Android technologies, allowing users to seamlessly control and monitor their smart devices.

## Key Features üî•

1.  **Home Screen**: 
    *   Displays current weather information (e.g., temperature, conditions, humidity).
    *   Shows a grid of smart devices like Smart Lighting, Air Condition, Smart TV, and Speakers.
    *   Provides quick on/off toggle controls for each device.
    *   Features category tabs (All Devices, Living Room, Bedroom, Kitchen) for filtering devices (Note: Full filtering logic might be a future enhancement).
2.  **Stats Screen**: A dedicated section to display device usage statistics and insights (currently a placeholder).
3.  **Settings Screen**: Allows users to configure application preferences and settings (currently a placeholder).
4.  **Profile Screen**: Displays user-specific information and account details (currently a placeholder).
5.  **Splash Screen**: A welcoming screen that appears on app launch, providing a smooth entry into the application.
6.  **Dynamic Theming**: Utilizes a gradient background that adapts across the app for a consistent and modern look.

## Technology Stack üõ†Ô∏è

*   **Kotlin**: Primary programming language.
*   **Jetpack Compose**: For building the declarative UI.
*   **Material You**: For modern UI components and theming.
*   **Coroutines**: For asynchronous operations and managing background tasks (e.g., in splash screen).
*   **Android Architecture Components**: Utilized implicitly with Jetpack Compose (e.g., `ViewModel` if you were to add it, `Lifecycle`).


## TODO / Future Enhancements üöÄ

*   Implement full functionality for Stats, Settings, and Profile screens.
*   Connect to actual smart home APIs or mock data sources.
*   Add device detail screens.
*   Implement theme switching (Light/Dark) if not fully dynamic yet.
*   Refine error handling and loading states.
